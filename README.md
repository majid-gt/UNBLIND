# UNBLIND
A REAL WORLD project based in IoT that detects the BLIND SPOT of a heavy vehicle ensuring the safety of people and driver

There are two files i have provided with
1. Ultrasonic - Just dump(upload) this code into an Arduino (Uno or any)
2. Camera - You require a ESP-32 Camera module for this to be work, you also need an ESP-32 Development board to dump the code into the camera module

And you are set with your project
You can access the camera server through the IP Address that will be printed on your Serial Monitor when you run this code in Arduino IDE
